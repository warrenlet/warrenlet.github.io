					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/SCR-20240216-ppuw.png"/>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>

						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> My favorite website is LinkedIn. <br>
								LinkedIn aims to facilitate professional networking, career development, and industry-related discussions. It's a platform for professionals across various industries to connect, share insights, and explore job opportunities. <br>
								Intended Audience: It's intended for professionals, job seekers, recruiters, and industry experts. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> The redesign addresses issues of profile visibility and information accessibility. In the original design, the user's profile and news feed might compete for attention.<br>
								Solutions Implemented: The redesigned wireframe highlights the user's profile more prominently, making it instantly noticeable. The news feed is reorganized for better readability, and the navigation bar is simplified to focus on the most used features, enhancing the user experience. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
