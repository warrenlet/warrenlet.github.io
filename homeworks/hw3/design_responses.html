                From the article "Typography can make or break your design: a
                process for choosing type" by Jonathan Z. White, I learned about
                the significant impact of typography on design. The article
                emphasizes that the right choice of typefaces can greatly
                influence the overall aesthetic and effectiveness of a design,
                conveying the desired mood, tone, and style. It serves as a
                comprehensive guide, providing practical advice on selecting
                suitable fonts based on the design's purpose and target
                audience. Additionally, it highlights the importance of
                considering font legibility, readability, and offers insights
                into effective font pairing and the creation of a typography
                style guide.

              </p>
              <p>
                My favorite part of the article is where it discusses the beauty
                and complexity of typography and how some people dedicate their
                entire careers to this field. It's fascinating to consider that
                something as seemingly simple as font choice can be a lifelong
                pursuit for some, indicating the depth and importance of
                typography in design. This section underscores the passion and
                dedication that typographers have for their craft and the
                extensive resources available for anyone interested in
                typography.
