        <h1>Reading responses</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>From this article, I learned that developing a keen eye for design is not just about using apps, but also about studying them with intention. The process of deconstructing an app's design can reveal insights into the design's hierarchy, content, intent, and audience, all of which contribute to the user experience.</li>
            <li>My favorite part of the article was the discussion about deconstructing apps to understand their components better. It's a practical exercise that encourages a deeper engagement with the products we often use passively, which can lead to a greater appreciation of the design process.</li>
            <li>"By routinely analyzing other apps, youâ€™ll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself."</li>
            <li>I would rate my enjoyment of this article as a solid 8. It was insightful and offered practical advice that can be applied not just to design, but to any field that requires a critical eye and thoughtful analysis.</li>
