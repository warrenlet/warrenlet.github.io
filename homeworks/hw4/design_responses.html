							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> From the article "A Guide to Color Accessibility in Product Design" from Inside Design Blog, I learned about the importance and methods of ensuring color accessibility in digital product design. The article emphasizes the significance of designing for people with visual impairments or color vision deficiencies, highlighting that millions of people are affected by such conditions. It provides practical tips for creating accessible color systems, such as ensuring sufficient contrast, not relying solely on color to convey information, and using patterns or textures to assist colorblind users. This approach is not only ethically important but also legally prudent in some cases. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the section on practical tips for ensuring color accessibility. It offers specific, actionable advice that designers can easily apply to their work, like checking the contrast ratio of color combinations, incorporating messages or icons for crucial system information, and providing options for texture or patterns in graphs for colorblind users. This part of the article is particularly useful because it transforms the concept of accessibility from an abstract idea into tangible design practices. </p>
